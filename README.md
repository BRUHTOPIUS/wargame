Based Repvblic Wargame Simulator

## Simple guide

First of all, you need to create a character. Ask the 『*World Runner*』 to make one for you. Your character has a name, chosen by you, and skills, chosen at random. 


As the character, you can travel around the world, form governments, get hired by governments, raise armies, etc.

Governments are just that, governments. They consist of politicians. These can be anything, dictators, finance ministers, consuls, water quality inspectors, blabla. They all have roles and powers. For example, the Generalissimo might have the power to enlist men from the government's territories, as well as to declare war, while the Finance Minister can set the national tax rate. Governments can also be vassals of other governments. Rebellions and stuff are also possible, of course.

Armies are another aspect of the game. Any character can raise an army. Armies owe their allegiance to characters, not governments. They can have a general as well as a number of commanders, and are made up of divisions. They can move around the world and fight with other armies, as well as besiege or plunder or genocide territories.

Territories make up the world. They can either be countrysides or cities. They have populations and economies. These determine how many soldiers or taxes you can get out of them.
